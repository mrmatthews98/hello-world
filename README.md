My name is Michael R. Matthews, I am a student at Wright State University, and I 
enjoy doing community service when possible. My favorite project was an "adopt-a-family"
event my Boy Scout troop put on for a few years. Seeing the joy on kids faces as
my troop showed up with a sack full of gifts will never leave me.
